# Countdown Timer with Tkinter ⏳🚀

This Python project utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface for setting up countdown timers with specific names and durations. Each timer runs independently in its own window, allowing users to keep track of multiple countdowns simultaneously.

## Features 🌟

- **User-friendly Interface:** The Tkinter GUI provides a simple and intuitive interface for entering countdown durations and names.
- **Multiple Timers:** Users can set up multiple countdown timers with unique names and durations.
- **Finish Button:** Each timer window includes a "Finish" button that, when clicked, marks the countdown as complete and disables the timer.
- **Dynamic Layout:** The layout dynamically adjusts as more timers are added, ensuring an organized display of timers.

## Learning Outcomes 💡

- **Threading and Thread Safety:** Practice and enhance your understanding of Python's threading library by implementing countdown timers in a multi-threaded environment.
- **GUI Programming with Tkinter:** Gain hands
