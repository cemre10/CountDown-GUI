# ‚è≥ Countdown Timer with Tkinter 

This Python project utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface for setting up countdown timers with specific names and durations. Each timer runs independently in its own window, allowing users to keep track of multiple countdowns simultaneously.

## üåü Features 

- **Threaded Countdowns:** Utilizes Python's threading library to handle countdowns concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The Tkinter GUI provides a simple and intuitive interface for entering countdown durations and names.
- **Multiple Timers:** Users can set up multiple countdown timers with unique names and durations.
- **Finish Button:** Each timer window includes a "Finish" button that, when clicked, marks the countdown as complete and disables the timer.
- **Dynamic Layout:** The layout dynamically adjusts as more timers are added, ensuring an organized display of timers.

## üí° Learning Outcomes 

- **Threading and Thread Safety:** Practice and enhance your understanding of Python's threading library by implementing countdown timers in a multi-threaded environment.
- **GUI Programming with Tkinter:** Practice and enhance your understanding of Python's tkinter library.

## üöÄ Getting Started 

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Tkinter library (included in most Python installations)
   - Threading library (included in Python standard library)


2. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/CountDown-GUI.git
      ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the project directory.

      ```bash
      cd CountDown-GUI
      ```

   - Run the Python script.

      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```

4. **Set Countdowns:**
   - Enter the countdown duration in the format `dd:hh:mm:ss`.
   - Provide a name for the countdown.
   - Click the "Click Me" button to start the timer.
